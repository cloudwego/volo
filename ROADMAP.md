# Volo Roadmap

This document provides description of items that the project decided to prioritize. This should
serve as a reference point for Volo contributors to understand where the project is going, and
help determine if a contribution could be conflicting with some longer term plans.

The fact that a feature isn't listed here doesn't mean that a patch for it will automatically be
refused! We are always happy to receive patches for new cool features we haven't thought about,
or didn't judge to be a priority. Please however understand that such patches might take longer
for us to review.
